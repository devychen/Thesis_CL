# Notes For Thesis

Proposal and paper access from [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fbhjtzxsnzjb#78ecdc) (View only).

# To Polina: About the Papers
1. [Xu et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10249) and [Guo et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01680) are the two review papers that I found most useful in this field (i.e. LLM-based multi-agent interactive system). There might be other ones but they are sufficient so far. They summaried the workflow, framework, architecture, purposes of most representative previous works. They also have Git repos where all works mentioned could be accessed. For your convenient here're the links: [Xu.ea](https://github.com/BAAI-Agents/GPA-LM), [Guo.ea](https://github.com/taichengguo/LLM_MultiAgents_Survey_Papers) 
2. Three possibly most relevant games and respective works are listed below. They are all communicative games with high requirements on cooperation, collaboration, competition and heavily rely on natural languages - a key feature of LLM agents. 
- Avalon: [Paper 1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14985), [paper 2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05036), [paper 3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01320)
- Diplomacy: [Paper 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08901), [Paper 2](https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.ade9097?casa_token=AB3PXQnKr8YAAAAA:pJO8TUkmbEUH77IhRcn-4r9PpxQc0jRgKokE3ElhmFvAhyTdjjS8aHOgJ_ViH_BnJwMDtTqdMmJgug)

# Meeting Notes 0425 (tbc)

Many systems were designed in different frameworks, architectures and for different purposes. So let's evaluate them in one setting which have most elements covered. Then to discover which is the best and why. These might include:
- Deceptive environment.
- Input from both environment and agent interactions. **Question** Too hard???
- Evaluation of success rate, and dialogue analysis.
- A more dynamic environment where agents are allowed to interrupt each other. (**Question** Or focus only on this? I rarely find any work on this, they are all sequential - complete thinking then act).
- Agents have characters, have different stands (rivals).

### Questions:
1. Too big???
2. Choice of games
- Rare research on LLM-based multi-agent using Cluedo.
- Can we use a novel setting, not an existing one?
- Game should be used for specific purpose.
3. Using CoT as baseline.
4. I can't tell the clear difference between previous works, how to categories them in terms of underlying architecture etc.
5. I might really lack solid background, but I really wanna do this well.
