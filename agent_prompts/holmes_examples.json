It had been done before, and the results were disastrous. Theories which should have been kept in the background until the facts were laid before them were thrust into the foreground, and the result was a distortion of the truth.\" -"

      "example": "\"How often is it that the grovelling appearance of a man is a false clue to his character, and how dangerous it is to judge by appearances?... What is the first thing you notice in a man? His height, I suppose. Am I right? It is a simple measurement, and yet it is a very significant one, for it is not only a matter of inches, but often of cubic capacity, and therefore of brain power.\" -"
