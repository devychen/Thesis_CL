### Notes
1. Game: deceptive, communcative games. Test-bed for decision-making and language-processing capabilities.
2. Interruption is more a "communication" matter. Is it possible to combine then?

### Light.ea-23-Avalon

1. Work: **`AvalonBench`**, a agme engine to benchmark the Multi-LLM agents. Includes: 1/ a game environment to play Avalon, 2/ rule-based AI bots as baseline opponents, 3/ ReAct-style i.e Reason-then-Act (_Yao.ea-23_) LLM agents with tailored prompts for each role.
2. Model: GPT-3.5, Llama2
3. Evaluation: Baseline strategy - against NAIVE agents:
- no consideration in dialogue, voting history;
- belive other plays will do the same. 
4. Notes: 4 phrases of Avalon: team selection - voting - quest/action - assassination. Each has a discussion.
