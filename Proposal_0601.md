**Three Detectives in a Room:**   
**Investigating Character Consistency and Interactions in Multi-Agent LLM Dialogue**

Yifei Chen | *Supervisor: Polina Tsvilodub*

### Background

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there has been growing interest in their ability to simulate fictional characters in narrative and interactive settings. Role-playing language agents powered by LLMs show impressive fluency but often suffer from inconsistencies in characters, undermining the consistency and believability of dialogue. Most existing work focuses on single agent simulation or on agent architectures, training paradigms, there is a gap in understanding character consistency in a multi-agent interaction setting from a more linguistic grounded perspective. This thesis investigates: **How well do LLM agents maintain distinct characters in collective task solving?**

### Question

This research focus on how LLM-based agents maintain their characters in collaborative dialogue from a linguistically grounded perspective, asking:

* RQ1: How well do agents remain in character across dialogue?  
* RQ2: What linguistic signals indicate breakdowns in character?  
* RQ3: How does character inconsistency affect the interaction?  
* RQ4: How does the interaction influence individual character coherence?  
- RQ1 & 2 are about the evaluation of character consistency in multi-agent interactions. RQ3 & 4 are about the correlation of interactions and character consistency.

### Outcomes

This thesis contributes to a linguistically grounded framework for analysing LLM-based multiple role-play agents simulation, with future implications for human-AI interaction design such as AI companions or AI Non-Player Characters. Deliverables include:

* A hierarchical evaluation framework across lexical, syntactic and discourse levels.  
* A detailed design of character profile.  
* Linguistically grounded metrics for character coherence.  
* A novel experimental setup using dialogue simulation in mystery-solving tasks with three characters: Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple.

### Agent Construction

The research will construct three agents: *Sherlock Holmes*, *Hercule Poirot*, *Miss Marple*. Implementation via **AutoGen** for multi-agent orchestration, and **LangChain Agents** for prompt and memory management. Each agent includes (Use prompting engineering):

* **System prompt**: full character profile (See Appendix 1 & 2 for example).  
* **Protective prompt** (Shao et al,. 20203): non-negotiable traits, e.g. *"You avoid sentimentality."*  
* **Minimal memory buffer**: linguistic markers, interaction log, deviation log etc. No embedding recall such as RAG.  
- The research will use an open-source model of a large size (e.g. Llama 70B) and resort to the cheapest GPT (GPT 4.1 nano) if needed.

### Dialogue Protocol

There are two dialogue modes, each containing three stages which are inspired by Baltaji et al (2023). We will run each simulation mode 10 times.

**1\. Collaborative Mode** \- Three detectives combine cues to solve a murder case (Case will be extracted from original books).    
*Stage 1\. Onboarding*

- Each detective will only be given partial information about the crime. The information is deliberately assigned based on their distinct detective style. Based on this initial information, they will independently submit an initial case report.

*Stage 2\. Discussion*

- Detectives exchange information and reach a consensus (or fail to).   
- **Task terminates** when they reach a joint conclusion on the truth of the crime (who and how), or maximumly in 10 turns.

*Stage 3\. Reflection*

- Each detective independently submits their final case reports.

**2\. Competition Mode** \- Each detective defends their reasoning methodology in a structured debate.  
*Stage 1\. Onboarding*

- Each agent independently submits an initial statement, stating their own detective methodology, and states their initial opinion on that of others.

*Stage 2\. Discussion*

- Detectives debate on who has the best detective methodology.   
- **Task terminates** when in 10 turns regardless of reaching a conclusion or not.

*Stage 3\. Reflection*

- Each detective independently submits their final statements.

### Evaluation

The evaluation contains (B) automatic and qualitative metrics and (2) an ablation study. The metrics will be applied to each dialogue turn to investigate the trajectory of character consistency, and for comparing initial and final reports. 

**Part A. Metrics**  
The linguistic grounded evaluation framework has a hierarchical design: lexical \- syntactic \- discourse level. Below is its mapping to research questions. **To measure consistency and contamination of characters in …**

**1/ Lexical Level**

- *Character-specific vocabulary rate*: Measures alignment with each character’s typical lexicon and their domain (forensic terms, french phrases) — Methods: Keyword hit rate  
  - RQ1 \- 2: keep stable for each agent between each simulation to indicate character consistency.  
  - RQ3 \- 4: a decrease correlates with poor task performance.  
- *Intra-agent cosine distance*: Quantifies how linguistically distinct each character’s utterances are from the others —-  Methods: Cosine similarity between turn pairs.  
  - RQ1 \- 2: keep distinct between agents in each simulation.  
  - RQ3 \- 4: larger similarity between agents correlates with poor task performance.  
- *Vocabulary contamination marker*: Marks when adopting another’s specific vocabulary. Counts the frequency —  Methods: Keyword hit rate  
  - RQ1 \- 2: low for each agent between each simulation to indicate low contamination between characters.  
  - RQ3 \- 4: rise after being challenged (e.g., disagreement in the dialogue happens).

**2/ Syntactic Level**

- *Syntactic structure consistency*: syntactic complexity (e.g., clauses per sentence or parse tree depth) across dialogue stages. — Methods: dependency parsing with Spacy  
  - RQ1 \- 2: keep stable for each agent between each simulation to indicate character consistency.  
  - RQ3 \- 4: chaotic after being challenged.

**3/ Discourse Level**

- *Dialogue act markers*: labels sentences in each turn with communicative intent \- (1) *Agreement*, (2) *Challenge* —-  Methods: Manually tagging or rule-based  
  - Mainly used for analysis.  
  - Sherlock should have the highest “challenge” frequency, while Miss Marple the lowest.  
- *Sentiment trend*: Measures emotional trajectory of each character —-  Methods: VADER  
  - RQ1 \- 2: keep stable for each agent between each simulation to indicate character consistency.  
  - RQ3 \- 4: change after being challenged.  
- *Stance marker*: mark the stance change in each turn: changed or unchanged. —  Methods: Manually tagging or rule-based  
  - RQ1 \- 2: keep stable for each agent between each simulation to indicate character consistency.  
  - RQ3 \- 4: change after being challenged.  
- *Detective methodology contamination marker*: mark when character adopts another's methodology. — Methods: Manually tagging or rule-based  
  - RQ1 \- 2: low for each agent between each simulation to indicate character consistency.  
  - RQ3 \- 4: chaotic after being challenged.  
- *Discourse pattern deviation marker*: Checks internal contradictions in dialogue which violate its original discourse pattern. —  Methods: Manually tagging or rule-based  
  - RQ1 \- 2: low for each agent between each simulation to indicate character consistency.  
  - RQ3 \- 4: rise after being challenged.

**4/ Task Performance**

- *Task outcomes*: Checks the rates of task (1) failure, (2) incompleted, and (3) success.  
  - A marker used for exploratory analysis.

**Part B.** **Ablation Study**   
Ablation study is applied to compare five conditions (\*if too complicated/too much workload, only with & without profile will be implemented). All of the above metrics will be applied to each turn to construct character consistency and its correlation with interactions between the settings.

- With full profile (Full system \+ prompts): Baseline performance  
- *\*With only language styles: for comparisons*  
- *\*With only personal traits*  
- *\*With only detective methodology*  
- Without profile (Generic reasoning agents):

**Part C. Model-based Baseline** (Recommended)  
To supplement the hand-crafted linguistic metrics, we will implement a text classification model as a model-based baseline to evaluate character consistency. This classifier will be trained on dialogue utterances from original Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, and Miss Marple texts (all in the public domain), mapping input text to one of four classes: SH, HP, MM, or Other.  
**Purpose**:

- To provide a less hand-crafted, probabilistic benchmark for character attribution.  
- To measure uncertainty and prediction shifts across dialogue turns as indicators of character drift or contamination.  
- To validate the informativeness of linguistic metrics by correlating them with classifier confidence and misclassification patterns.

**Implementation Plan**:

- Collect labeled utterances from canonical texts for each character.  
- Fine-tune a transformer-based classifier (e.g., DistilBERT or RoBERTa) for 4-way classification.  
- During dialogue simulations, input each character’s utterance into the classifier:  
  - Record prediction confidence and probability shifts over time.  
  - Compare predicted class with assigned character to track inconsistencies.  
- Use this classifier as an auxiliary evaluation layer alongside linguistic markers.
