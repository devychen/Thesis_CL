Extract the key traits that identify the character in the following text and produce a single, cohesive prompt suitable for LLM character simulation or prompt engineering. The output must consist of exactly eight sentences, with two sentences each dedicated to the characterâ€™s vocabulary, sentence structure, discourse pattern, personality traits, and investigative methods.
Do not include any bullet points, lists, formatting, or section headings.
The content of each sentence must be based strictly on the original text; do not invent or infer beyond what is explicitly stated.
Begin the prompt with: "You are {name}. You are {occupation}."
End the prompt with: "Stay in character at all times."
